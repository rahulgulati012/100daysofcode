# 100 Days of Code Challenge Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! This project is a public commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my progress, share the code I'm working on, and stay accountable throughout the challenge.

## Repository Structure

- **/day-1 to /day-100:** Each day has its dedicated folder where you can find the code I wrote on that particular day. The code files are appropriately named and organized.

- **/readme.md:** This file contains a daily log of my progress. It includes a brief summary of the tasks completed, challenges faced, and lessons learned each day.

- **/resources:** If applicable, this folder may contain any additional resources, documentation, or notes related to the code produced during the challenge.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in following my 100 Days of Code journey, here's how you can get started:

1. **Explore Daily Code:** Browse through the folders labeled /day-1 to /day-100 to see the code written on each day of the challenge.

2. **Read Daily Log:** Check the /log.md file for a detailed daily log of my progress, challenges, and insights. It's a great way to understand the thought process behind the code.

3. **Clone the Repository:** If you'd like to explore the code locally or even contribute, feel free to clone the repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulgulati012/100DaysOfCode.git

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Q: What if I miss a day?
A: If you miss a day, don't worry. Life happens, and the goal is progress, not perfection. Try to make up for missed days, but if you can't, continue the challenge from where you left off.

Q: Can I count non-coding activities?
A: The primary focus is coding, but related activities like learning, reading documentation, or solving coding challenges can be included. The key is to stay engaged with coding in some form.

Q: Can I start the challenge at any time?
A: Absolutely! The challenge is flexible, and you can start at any time. What matters most is your commitment to coding consistently for 100 days.
